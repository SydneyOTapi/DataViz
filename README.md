# DataViz
Hi, my name is Sydney O'Tapi. I'm a junior at [Lehigh University](http://www1.lehigh.edu/) majoring in Journalism with two minors in Graphic Design and Global Studies. 
I'm interested in combining graphic design and writing and pursuing a career in communications.I enjoy writing, art and music. This github page is use for my Data Visulization course that covers different aspects of data journalism.
